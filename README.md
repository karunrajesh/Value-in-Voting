# Value-in-Voting

The goal of this project is to understand more about the current trends in voting and the value in a singular vote. We then draw inferences for the values in a single vote in 2024 election.

You can download this repo onto your local machine and run the Initial_Wrangling.Rmd to generate the Initial_Wrangling.Rmd file. The app.R file will generate an R Shiny app that allows for user interaction.

The necessary data files are located within the Data folder on this repo.


Overview:

Voting has become an increasingly important topic, especially in the United States. Studies have shown that those ages 18 to 29 have consistently voted at lower levels, over 15% lower, than general election turnout. This can be attributed to many reasons. Habit formation in initial voting, opportunity cost of voting, and alternative participation like protesting. Another reason is that the value of voting is not apparent. Someone voting in California, where it will almost assuredly vote democratic, may not see a point to participating in a process where their vote is drowned in a sea of trillions of others. 

Without this knowledge of value, people will not understand the impact they can have and continue to be unseen in elections. To increase voter turnout, it is imperative that the value of one’s vote becomes clear at every level of election around them. For instance, the 2020 election has been one of the most heavily funded elections with the most voter turnout in U.S. history. The record number of civil engagements highlighted the importance of this election. We have seen many different organizations like the NFL, NBA, Facebook, and others continuously push voting ad-campaigns like never before. It immediately made us think about the value of our singular votes and how much change we can affect with just this one action. We also wanted to provide an alternative view to the case of voting, besides the worn out “civic duty” argument, to peers around us who did not see reason in voting.
 
However, just how much is your vote worth? How much does a vote actually matter in terms of its economic impact? These questions could be critical in future campaign in promoting voting by directly demonstrating in a quantitative fashion how much impact each vote makes. 
 
In order to begin answering these questions, we obtained a detailed breakdown of data on voter turnout, how much money each administration has spent on relevant sectors such as education, agriculture, military dense etc. and the possibility of a single vote overturning election results by state from past US presidential elections. We then can calculate the monetary value of each vote for particular sectors of interests. Further we hope to use these datasets to draw inferences for the values in a single vote in 2024 election.
